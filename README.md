### OldFashionPound

A library (package OldFashionPound) implementing the 4 arithmetic operations (sum, subtraction, multiplication and division) for pre-1970 UK prices.

Under the old money system of UK, before 1970, there were 12 pence in a shilling and 20 shillings, or 240 pence, in a pound. Thus, a price in th OldUK Money system was expressed in Pounds, Shillings and Pence.

For example "12p 6s 10d" is 12 Pounds, 6 Shillings and 10 Pence.


Sum and Subtraction should add or subtract two prices respectively.

Example SUM:
* 5p 17s 8d + 3p 4s 10d = 9p 2s 6d

Example SUBTRACTION:
* 5p 17s 8d - 3p 4s 10d = 2p 12s 10d

Subtractions giving negative results are managed:
* 5p 17s 8d - 5p 18s 8d = 0d (-1s 0d)


Multiplication and division will multiply or divide a price by an integer

Example MULTIPLICATION:
* 5p 17s 8d * 2 = 11p 15s 4d

Example DIVISION:
* 5p 17s 8d / 3 = 1p 19s 2d (2d)

Another Example DIVISION
* 18p 16s 1d / 15 = 1p 5s 0d (1s 1d)
